## Create a Crypto Wallet and Hire a Fintech Professional


## Overview 
### We have created a web application that allows customers to find fintech professionals available for hire, hire them, and send them payment in the form of cryptocurrency. The customer can review a list of candidates, select one, review their hourly rate, select a quantity of time to hire them for, and hire them by submitting payment to their Ethereum account.
